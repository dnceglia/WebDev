		<h1>Grand Slams</h1>

		<div>One of my interests growing up was playing tennis. During the year, 
		I spent a good amount of time stringing tennis rackets and watching 
		the major tennis tournaments known as the Grand Slams. Here's a 
		brief introduction to them.</div>

	<main>
	     <div class="row">
		<h2>The Australian Open</h2>
		    <div class="col-1-2">
			<div class="body-paragraph">The first major tennis tournament of the year is 					played in mid-January, "down-under", in Melbourne, Australia. This 
			tournament has been played at the Melbourne Park facility 
			for nearly 30 years. It is known as a "hard-court" tournament
			due to its Plexicushion surface. The event attracts the top players 
			from around the world to compete for the almost $40 million USD 
			prize purse that is split between participants.</div>
		    </div>
		<h2>The French Open</h2>
		    <div class="col-1-2">
			<div class="body-paragraph">The second Grand Slam held at the end of May is the 			French Open, at Roland Garros. It is held in Paris in the Boulogne-Billancourt 
			neighborhood which is surrounded by the Seine river. What's unique about the 					French Open is that it is the only major tournament played on red
			crushed brick. The surface, called a clay court, causes the ball to bounce 
			higher than on hard or grass courts and requires the players 
			to slide often when chasing down the ball.</div>
		    </div>
	     </div>

	     <div class="row">
		<h2>Wimbledon</h2>
		    <div class="col-1-2">
			<div class="body-paragraph">The third and oldest major tennis tournament is The 			Championships, Wimbledon held in July. The event is played at the All England Lawn 
			Tennis and Croquet Club, and as the name implies, is played on grass. 
			Odd features of this tournament is a stict "all-white clothing" dress code, 
			no visible title sponsorship like at the other majors and of course, the 
			Royal Box for the Royal Family.</div>
		    </div>
		<h2>The U.S. Open</h2>
		    <div class="col-1-2">
			<div class="body-paragraph">The final grand slam of the tennis calendar occurs in 				Flushing Meadows, NY at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center. Originally, played on 				grass, the tournament was played on clay shortly before being changed to the hard 				court surface, DecoTurf. This hard court surface is fast and similar to the surface 
			at Melbourne Park. The main event court is named Arthur Ashe Stadium and is 
			the largest tennis related stadium in the world.</div>
